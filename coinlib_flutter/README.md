# Coinlib for Flutter

This package provides flutter support for the coinlib library for Peercoin and
other cryptocoins. A `CoinlibLoader` widget is included that must be used when
targeting web to ensure the library is ready to be used.

An example app is provided in `example/` that demonstrates use of the loader
widget. Beyond this the coinlib library documentation can be followed.

Currently only web targets are supported.
