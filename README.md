# MultiCoinlib

MultiCoinlib is a straight-forward and modular library for Peercoin and other similar
cryptocoins including Taproot support. This library allows for the construction
and signing of transactions and management of BIP32 wallets.

This repository contains the dart-only library in the `multicoinlib` directory and a
flutter wrapper in the `multicoinlib_flutter` directory which includes support for
flutter platforms.

The packages [multicoinlib](https://pub.dev/packages/multicoinlib) and
[multicoinlib_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/multicoinlib_flutter) are available on
pub.dev.
