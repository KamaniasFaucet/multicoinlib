# Coinlib

**This is a release-candidate.**

Coinlib is a straight-forward and modular library for Peercoin and other similar
cryptocoins. This library allows for the construction and signing of
transactions and management of BIP32 wallets.

This repository contains the dart-only library in the `coinlib` directory and a
flutter wrapper in the `coinlib_flutter` directory which includes support for
flutter platforms.
